Description:
We have been asked to perform a penetration test on an old and poorly maintained website that is still exposed to the internet. The main application appears to be inaccessible, but the organization believes there may still be hidden components running on the server. Your task is to assess the target, identify any exposed services, and determine whether a compromise is possible. Can you help us complete the penetration test and uncover what is really running behind the scenes?
